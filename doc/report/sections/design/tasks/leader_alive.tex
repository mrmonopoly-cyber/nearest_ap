\subsubsection{Leader Alive}

The \textbf{Leader Alive} task is executed periodically by each node. Upon execution,
the node performs a \textbf{Leader check}[\ref{def:leader_check}] on its local state.
If the node determines itself to be the current leader, it broadcasts a
\textbf{LeaderHeartbit}[\ref{message:leader_heartbeat}] message to all other nodes.

This task does not participate in leader election; its sole purpose is to advertise the continued
presence and validity of the current leader.
