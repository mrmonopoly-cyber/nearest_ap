\subsection{Tasks}

The last major components of the protocol are the \textbf{tasks}, which define the local behavior
of each node. Tasks are executed independently on every node and are responsible for periodically
evaluating the node state, sending messages, and reacting to changes observed in the network.

Each task operates at a configurable execution frequency\footnote
{
  All task frequencies are configurable in the protocol implementation\cite{5}.
}, allowing the protocol to be tuned for different environments and hardware constraints.
Tasks do not communicate directly with each other; instead, they interact solely through the
node’s internal state and the exchange of protocol messages.

The following subsections describe the tasks that collectively implement leader monitoring,
message processing, and election initiation.
