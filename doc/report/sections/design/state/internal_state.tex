\subsection{Node Internal State}

Each node maintains an internal state divided into the following components:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Topology}: describes the static network configuration, including the total number
    of nodes\footnote{
      At the current state of the protocol the network configuration is static. Nodes may be
      unreachable, but they are still considered members of the network.
    }.
  \item \textbf{Node Potentials}[\ref{def:potential}]: stored potentials for:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item the current node
      \item the current leader
      \item the current best candidate[\ref{def:best_candidate}]
    \end{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Leader Heartbeat}[\ref{def:heartbeat}]
  \item \textbf{Best Candidate Heartbeat}[\ref{def:heartbeat}]
  \item \textbf{Leader Identifier}: identifier of the current leader
  \item \textbf{Best Candidate Identifier}: identifier of the current best candidate
  \item \textbf{Election Time Scale Factor}[\ref{def:time_scale}]: a local factor used to modulate
    the execution frequency of the election task. It dynamically
    modulates how frequently a node may initiate elections, increasing under contention and
    decreasing in the presence of stable leadership signals.
  \item \textbf{Vote Info}: election-related metadata, including:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item total number of nodes
      \item number of positive votes
      \item current election round
      \item flags indicating whether an election was initiated or a vote was cast
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
Separate heartbeat counters are maintained for the leader and the best candidate to distinguish
between leadership stability and candidate dominance under message loss.
