\textbf{NewElection}$(id, potential, round)$ is a message broadcast by a node that intends to
initiate a new leader election. The message carries the following fields:

  \item \textbf{id}: the identifier of the candidate node initiating the election;
  \item \textbf{potential}: the current potential of the candidate;
  \item \textbf{round}: the election round associated with this election attempt.
