\subsubsection{LeaderHeartbeat}\label{message:leader_heartbeat}

\textbf{LeaderHeartbeat}$(id, potential, round)$ is a message periodically broadcast by the
current leader to advertise its presence and propagate leadership information.
The message carries the following fields:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{id}: the identifier of the leader node;
  \item \textbf{potential}: the current potential of the leader;
  \item \textbf{round}: the election round associated with the leader’s current leadership.
\end{itemize}

Upon reception of a valid leader heartbeat, nodes update their local view of the leader state,
refresh the leader heartbeat counter, and suppress election attempts if the leader’s potential
remains competitive.
