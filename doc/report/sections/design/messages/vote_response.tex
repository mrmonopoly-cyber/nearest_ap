\subsubsection{VoteResponse}\label{message:vote_response}

\textbf{VoteResponse}$(new\_leader, potential, round)$ is a message broadcast by a node to endorse
a candidate that has initiated a leader election. The message carries the following fields:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{new\_leader}: the identifier of the candidate node being endorsed;
  \item \textbf{potential}: the potential of the endorsed candidate;
  \item \textbf{round}: the election round associated with the corresponding \textbf{NewElection}
    message.
\end{itemize}

Vote response messages are sent only when a node decides to support a candidate. They serve both to
notify the candidate of received support and to propagate information about the endorsed node to
the rest of the network.
