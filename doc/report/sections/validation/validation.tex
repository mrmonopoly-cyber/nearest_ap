\section{Protocol Validation}

To validate the design data from the simulations has been collected. The simulations has been 
created by analyzing the time for the best candidate to become the actual leader. To model
the lost of the message each a node has a fixed probability to drop the message before passing it
to the protocol API. The data has been gathered by repeating the experiments with different
probabilities and number of nodes using the following network configuration.
All the nodes has different static potential and the initial default leader is the node
with lower potential (the worst possible leader). Then the simulations starts and it ends
when the node with the greatest potential became leader.
All the nodes uses the same frequency for their tasks plus a minor random time unique to each node.
