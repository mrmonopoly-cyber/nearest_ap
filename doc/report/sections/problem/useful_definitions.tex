\section{Useful Definitions}

Before describing the protocol in detail, several terms used throughout this work are formally
defined.

\begin{definition}[Potential]\label{def:potential}
  The \textbf{potential} of a node is a non-negative integer $p \in \mathbb{N}$ computed locally by
  each node. It represents an application-dependent measure of the node's suitability to act as
  leader (e.g., remaining battery level, signal quality, or a combination thereof).
  The objective of the protocol is to select a node with maximal potential.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Tolerance]\label{def:tolerance}
  The \textbf{tolerance} is a non-negative integer $t \in \mathbb{N}$ used when comparing node
  potentials. A node is considered strictly better than another only if its potential exceeds the
  other's potential by more than $t$. The tolerance parameter is introduced to reduce oscillations
  and excessive leader re-elections. A tolerance value of zero disables this mechanism.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Best Candidate]\label{def:best_candidate}
  The \textbf{best candidate} is the node currently known to have the highest potential among all
  observed nodes. This notion is based on locally available information and may differ across
  nodes due to message loss or delays.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Heartbeat]\label{def:heartbeat}
  A \textbf{heartbeat} is a periodically refreshed counter used to infer the continued activity
  of a node, particularly the current leader. If the counter is not refreshed within a given time
  window, the corresponding node is assumed to be unreachable or inactive for the purposes of
  leader election.
  Heartbeats are consumed by local tasks and may expire independently for the leader and the best
  candidate.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Leader Check]\label{def:leader_check}
  A node declares itself leader if the following conditions hold:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item the node has won the most recent election round;
    \item the node's potential is greater than or equal to the potential of the current best
      candidate.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Election Time Scale Factor]\label{def:time_scale}
  The election time scale factor is a local, positive integer associated with each node.
  It multiplicatively scales the execution frequency of the Potential Election task.
  The factor has a minimum value of 1.

  The factor is \textbf
  {
    increased when a node initiates an election while not being the best candidate,
    decreased upon reception of valid leader heartbeats
  }, and \textbf
  {
    reset to its minimum value when both leader and best-candidate heartbeats expire
  }, enabling fast recovery after silence.
\end{definition}
