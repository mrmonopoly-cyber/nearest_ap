\section{Problem Definition}

Based on the context introduced above, the problem addressed by this work can now be defined
formally.

\begin{problem}[Leader Election]\label{prob:leader_election}
  Let $G = (V, E)$ be a complete-directed graph, where each node $n \in V$ is associated with a
  scalar \textbf{potential} $p(n)$ (see Definition~\ref{def:potential}).
  Communication between nodes occurs by exchanging messages along directed edges. Message delivery is unreliable: each transmitted message may be lost with non-zero probability.

  The objective is to determine a \textbf{leader} node $n^\ast \in V$ such that
  \[
    n^\ast \in \arg\max_{n \in V} p(n).
  \]
\end{problem}

The problem must be solved in a continuous and dynamic manner, as node potentials may change
over time. Consequently, the protocol is required to adapt to variations in potentials and
re-elect a leader when necessary.

The protocol is not required to guarantee immediate convergence; instead, it aims for eventual
leader convergence under probabilistic message delivery and adaptive timing constraints.
