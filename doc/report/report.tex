%% article.
\begin{abstract}
This work presents NearestAP, a distributed protocol for eventual leader convergence in clusters
composed of autonomous nodes communicating exclusively through unreliable broadcast channels.
The protocol does not rely on any connection-oriented mechanism at any layer, making it suitable
for embedded and cyber-physical systems operating over non-conventional or lossy buses.

NearestAP enables a group of nodes to converge toward the selection of a single dominant leader
based on a locally defined potential metric. The protocol is resilient to extreme message loss
and does not assume synchronized clocks, reliable delivery, or bidirectional links. Experimental
evaluation through a Linux-based simulation framework shows that leader convergence is achieved
even when up to 90\% of messages are independently dropped at each node.

By favoring suppression and information diffusion over explicit coordination, NearestAP trades
optimal convergence time for robustness and simplicity, providing a practical solution for
leader selection in highly unreliable distributed environments.

% \begin{abstract}
%  This work presents NearestAP, a novel approach to determine the distributed consensus in a storm
%   of drones which do not rely on any form of connection-oriented protocol at any level. As I will show 
%   the protocol is able to eventually successfully determine the best drone in a group even if 90\% of the 
%   messages are lost for each drone. Since the protocol does not rely on any form of 
%   connection-oriented protocol it's particularly suited for the embedded world with non-conventional
%   bus.
