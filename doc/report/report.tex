%% article.
\begin{abstract}
  This work presents NearestAP, a distributed leader election protocol designed for clusters
  operating over unreliable, connectionless broadcast media. The protocol enables a group of
  autonomous drones to dynamically agree on a leader based on locally computed node potential,
  even under extreme message loss. NearestAP avoids connection-oriented communication and instead
  relies on probabilistic information dissemination, adaptive election timing, and silence-driven
  recovery mechanisms. Experimental evaluation in a simulated environment shows successful
  convergence even when up to 90\% of messages are lost per node, making the protocol
  particularly suitable for embedded systems operating over non-conventional buses.
\end{abstract}

% \begin{abstract}
%  This work presents NearestAP, a novel approach to determine the distributed consensus in a storm
%   of drones which do not rely on any form of connection-oriented protocol at any level. As I will show 
%   the protocol is able to eventually successfully determine the best drone in a group even if 90\% of the 
%   messages are lost for each drone. Since the protocol does not rely on any form of 
%   connection-oriented protocol it's particularly suited for the embedded world with non-conventional
%   bus.
